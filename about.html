			<h2>About Well-Known Boreholes</h2>
			<p>Here at Well-Known Boreholes, we will take part in a variety of activities. Here are a few of the things we will do. identifying regions in need of boreholes through conducting feasibility studies, seeking money to sponsor programs to build boreholes, identifying ideal areas for boreholes through working with local governments and people, the creation of boreholes, the installation of pumps and associated apparatus, By promoting awareness of water conservation and hygienic procedures, Peoples in rural areas without access to clean and safe water are the target demographic for monitoring and maintaining boreholes to ensure their sustainability and lifespan. Our NGO's first geographic focus will be on communities in Africa, with the possibility of later expanding to other areas. With regards to financing Well-Known Boreholes will look for funding from private individuals, business partners, and other associations that support our goals. By giving the proceeds from the sales of the fresh, pure water we bottle from the boreholes we install, this means we have a special way of getting funds from individuals in a retail environment.
